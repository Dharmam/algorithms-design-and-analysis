/**
 * Implemented and Inspired from the article :
 *  
 * 		https://www.topcoder.com/community/data-science/data-science-tutorials/algorithm-games/
 * 
 * A simple example is the following game, played by two players who take turns moving. At the beginning there are n coins. 
 * When it is a playerâ€™s turn he can take away 1, 3 or 4 coins. The player who takes the last one away is declared the winner 
 * (in other words, the player who can not make a move is the loser).
 * 
 * The question is: For what n will the first player win if they both play optimally?
